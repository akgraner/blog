The Kubeflow Community, known for its dedication to making machine learning workflows on Kubernetes simple, portable, and scalable, [has recently announced](https://groups.google.com/g/kubeflow-discuss/c/54PGJ-ypqc8) a significant milestone in its journey. For the first time, they are holding elections for the Kubeflow Steering Committee (KSC)!

The KSC will be crucial in guiding the project's direction, ensuring it continues to meet the needs of its growing user base. Candidates for this committee are drawn from the community's diverse members, embodying the spirit of open-source collaboration that Kubeflow cherishes.
This election marks a new chapter in Kubeflowâ€™s history, reflecting the community's commitment to a democratic project governance model. It serves as a testament to the community's growth, maturity, and dedication to inclusivity and shared decision-making.

The election process for the KSC is structured to ensure that every phase is transparent and fair. As per [the announced timeline](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/elections/kubeflow-steering-committee-elections-2023.md), we are currently in [the nomination phase](https://groups.google.com/g/kubeflow-discuss/c/dEs1aGSd_X4/m/n-6pMaCnAQAJ), where [eligible community members](https://github.com/kubeflow/community/blob/master/elections/eligible-candidates-and-voters-2023-KSC.md) are encouraged to nominate themselves or others for a position on the Committee. This stage will determine the group of candidates who will move forward to the testimonial phase and then the voting phase. It's an exciting time for the community, as members step up to the challenge and show their readiness to drive the project's future direction.

Elections like this in the open source ecosystem highlight the collaborative spirit that drives these initiatives. They provide the opportunity for anyone, regardless of their role in the project, to step up and help guide its future. Let's all join in congratulating the [Kubeflow Community](https://www.kubeflow.org/) on this milestone and look forward to the outcomes of this exciting election!
